= External Search Sources

This Rails engine provides an interface and helpers for pulling search results from external sources via rss feeds.


== Installation

=== Step 1

Install all dependancies.

* Plugin relies on ActiveScaffold for the admin interface.
* Plugin relied on Kete version of the Feedzirra gem

  sudo gem install kete-feedzirra

=== Step 2

Open a console, and in the root of you Rails application, install the plugin by running one of the following (depending on the method you use to import plugins):

* script/plugin install git://github.com/kete/external_search_sources.git
* piston import git://github.com/kete/external_search_sources.git vendor/plugins/external_search_sources
* git submodule add git://github.com/kete/external_search_sources.git vendor/plugins/external_search_sources
* Download the latest files ( http://github.com/kete/external_search_sources/tarball/master ) and extract to vendor/plugins/external_search_sources

=== Step 3

Install migrations and public images.

  rake external_search_sources:sync

=== Step 4

Update your database.

  rake db:migrate

=== Step 5

Where you want search sources displayed, add the following

  display_search_sources 'test'

Replace the string 'test' with a variable or other string you want search sources to return results of.

=== Step 6

Add some search sources. Go to /search_sources/list and add some data into the correct fields.


== Configuration

ExternalSearchSources has methods for [] (accessor) and []= (writer). The settings available can be found in

  lib/external_search_sources.rb


== Testing

The plugin comes with a test suite that can be run once the plugin is installed in an application.

Change into the plugins directory and run 'rake' to start them.

Note: The tests require Rails 2.2 or higher, and are currently tested on Rails 2.3 (so problems in older versions may arise - please see "Reporting an Issue" if they do)


== Reporting an Issue

If you have a problem, please report it on the external_search_sources plugin ticket tracker (on Ligthouseapp)

http://kete.lighthouseapp.com/projects/32521-external_search_sources/tickets

Be sure to include Rails version, plugin version, and when possible, a sample application that can reproduce the problem. Upload it to one of the various file hosting sites and link to it in the ticket. Don't include vendored rails or the external_search_sources plugin in the archive (if I know the versions, I'll add these myself).


== Contributing

If you've added something, why not share it. Fork the repository (http://github.com/kete/external_search_sources), make the changes and send a pull request to the maintainers.

Changes with tests, and full documentation are preferred.
